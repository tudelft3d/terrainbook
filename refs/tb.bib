@article{Guth2021,
	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide fundamental depictions of the three-dimensional shape of the Earth's surface and are useful to a wide range of disciplines. Ideally, DEMs record the interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, with complexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intended use, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them. DEM is a general term, and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) record the treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible and near-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars and products of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storage structure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same convention for the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable data spacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understanding and reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users, who do not necessarily share the same background.},

  abstract = {At least 10 global digital elevation models (DEMs) at one-arc-second resolution now cover Earth. Comparing derived grids, like slope or curvature, preserves surface spatial relationships, and can be more important than just elevation values. Such comparisons provide more nuanced DEM rankings than just elevation root mean square error (RMSE) for a small number of points. We present three new comparison categories: fraction of unexplained variance (FUV) for grids with continuous floating point values; accuracy metrics for integer code raster classifications; and comparison of stream channel vector networks. We compare six global DEMs that are digital surface models (DSMs), and four edited versions that use machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to create a bare-earth digital terrain model (DTM) for different elevation ranges: full Earth elevations, under 120 m, under 80 m, and under 10 m. We find edited DTMs improve on elevation values, but because they do not incorporate other metrics in their training they do not improve overall on the source Copernicus DSM. We also rank 17 common geomorphic-derived grids for sensitivity to DEM quality, and document how landscape characteristics, especially slope, affect the results. None of the DEMs perform well in areas with low average slope compared to reference DTMs aggregated from 1 m airborne lidar data. This indicates that accurate work in low-relief areas grappling with global climate change should use airborne lidar or very high resolution image-derived DTMs.},

@incollection{Bohner09,
	annote = {how terrain parameters/characteristic are useful for climatology

climatology uses terrain properties to predict and understand the climate, weather conditions averaged over a period of time. 

The solar irradiation (gradient, aspect, shading by features of the terrain (so they speak of sky-view factor), etc.) is useful to calculate the temperature of the ground at diff locations, to predict snow covering (elevation also plays a role). As is the case for 3DCM, the diffuse irradiation also plays a role.

Exposure to wind can be estimated using the land-surface parameters frequently used in modelling topographic solar radiation --- terrain aspect, illumination angle, horizon angle and sky view factor.

(It is the apex of each d-simplex, not shared by the other d-simplex, that matters.) If a triangulation is Delaunay, every hyperface of the triangulation is locally Delaunay. Conversely, if every hyperface of a triangulation is locally Delaunay, then the triangulation is Delaunay (i.e. every simplex is Delaunay). Delaunay himself [13] was the first to make this observation.},

How does it work: builts a graph from a delaunay triangulation with added diagonals, edges are then removed if the height span is larger than a treshold. Now only points in the largest connected component are kept, smaller connected components are regarded to as noise.},

This review highlights three feature types for which current ground filtering algorithms are suboptimal, and which can be improved upon in future studies: surfaces with rough terrain or discontinuous slope, dense forest areas that laser beams cannot penetrate, and regions with low vegetation that is often ignored by ground filters.},

The TanDEM-X mission systematically acquired data mainly between September 2017 and mid-2020 to create another global DEM, the so-called ``TanDEM-X DEM 2020'', formerly also called TanDEM-X Change DEM. The present paper describes the generation of the TanDEM-X DEM 2020 in terms of the adopted acquisition planning strategy, the new interferometric processing and DEM generation as well as the final DEM product specifications. The main differences from the existing global TanDEM-X DEM (2010-2014) are the new and independent time frame and a new interferometric processing technique with lower phase unwrapping errors, allowing for a mainly single-coverage acquisition strategy except for more difficult terrain. The fewer acquisitions slightly increase the random height errors but still very high accuracy. Examples for height changes on forests and glaciers between TanDEM-X DEM and TanDEM X DEM 2020 round off the paper with large-scale mosaics of Iceland and New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Production and validation of an open global ensemble digital terrain model (GEDTM30) and derived terrain variables at 1 arc-s spacing grid ( \$\textbackslash sim\${$\sim$} 30 m spatial resolution) is described. Copernicus DEM, ALOS World3D, and object height models were combined in a data fusion approach to generate a globally consistent digital terrain model (DTM). This DTM was then used to compute 15 standard terrain variables across six scales (30, 60, 120, 240, 480 and 960 m). A global-to-local transfer learning model framework with 5{$^\circ$} \texttimes{} 5{$^\circ$} tiling leveraged globally distributed lidar datasets: ICESat-2 ATL08 (best-fit terrain height) and GEDI02 (lowest mode elevation), totaling over 30 billion training points. A global model was initially fitted using ICESat-2 and GEDI, followed by locally optimized models per tile, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Independent validation shows that GEDTM30 reduces Copernicus DEM RMSE by about 25.4\% in built-up areas, 10.0\% in regions with 10--50\% tree cover, and 27.3\% in areas with over 50\% tree cover. Compared to state-of-the-art DTMs (MERIT DEM, FABDEM and FathomDEM), GEDTM30 achieves the lowest vertical errors when assessed with GNSS station records, yielding a standard deviation of 7.77 m, an RMSE of 10.69 m, and a mean error of 7.34 m. FathomDEM exhibited the lowest vertical RMSE when validated against independent reference DTMs. GEDTM30 was further used to generate multiscale variables of topography and hydrology through an optimized tiling workflow ( \$\textbackslash sim\${$\sim$} 800 tiles of 600 \texttimes{} 600 km with \$\textbackslash sim\${$\sim$} 16\% overlap) based on the Equi7 grid system. The entire workflow was implemented in Python using GDAL and Whitebox Workflows. Visual inspection confirmed the absence of boundary artifacts and the preservation of hydrologic connectivity. The tiling-based implementation significantly reduces computational costs of generating large-scale DTMs and derived terrain variables. The GEDTM30 dataset and code are publicly available as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs via Zenodo and the OpenLandMap STAC. Further fusion with local lidar-based DTMs and national DTMs is recommended to enhance local accuracy and level of detail.},

Existing global digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely used, however often suffer from systematic biases caused by trees, buildings and instrumentation error, ultimately limiting their effectiveness. We present here, FathomDEM, a new global 30 m DEM produced using a novel application of a hybrid vision transformer model. This model removes surface artifacts from a global radar DEM, Copernicus DEM, aligning it more closely with true topography. In addition to improving on other global DEMs, FathomDEM also has reduced error compared to coastal-focussed DEMs such as the recent DeltaDTM. This demonstrates its impressive capacity to perform for specific landscapes, while being trained globally to model a wide range of terrain types. FathomDEM has been tested on the downstream task of flood modeling, showing increased accuracy compared to those run with the previous best global DEM, FABDEM, approaching the performance of LiDAR based flood modeling. This improvement is attributed to FathomDEM's smaller error and substantial reduction in artifacts. This shows the suitability of FathomDEM for applied tasks and strengthens our evaluation compared to one based on vertical error alone.},

  abstract = {The primary objective of the European Space Agency's 7th Earth Explorer mission, BIOMASS, is to determine the worldwide distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) in order to reduce the major uncertainties in calculations of carbon stocks and fluxes associated with the terrestrial biosphere, including carbon fluxes associated with Land Use Change, forest degradation and forest regrowth. To meet this objective it will carry, for the first time in space, a fully polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Three main products will be provided: global maps of both AGB and forest height, with a spatial resolution of 200\,m, and maps of severe forest disturbance at 50\,m resolution (where ``global'' is to be understood as subject to Space Object tracking radar restrictions). After launch in 2022, there will be a 3-month commissioning phase, followed by a 14-month phase during which there will be global coverage by SAR tomography. In the succeeding interferometric phase, global polarimetric interferometry Pol-InSAR coverage will be achieved every 7\,months up to the end of the 5-year mission. Both Pol-InSAR and TomoSAR will be used to eliminate scattering from the ground (both direct and double bounce backscatter) in forests. In dense tropical forests AGB can then be estimated from the remaining volume scattering using non-linear inversion of a backscattering model. Airborne campaigns in the tropics also indicate that AGB is highly correlated with the backscatter from around 30\,m above the ground, as measured by tomography. In contrast, double bounce scattering appears to carry important information about the AGB of boreal forests, so ground cancellation may not be appropriate and the best approach for such forests remains to be finalized. Several methods to exploit these new data in carbon cycle calculations have already been demonstrated. In addition, major mutual gains will be made by combining BIOMASS data with data from other missions that will measure forest biomass, structure, height and change, including the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar deployed on the International Space Station after its launch in December 2018, and the NASA-ISRO NISAR L- and S-band SAR, due for launch in 2022. More generally, space-based measurements of biomass are a core component of a carbon cycle observation and modelling strategy developed by the Group on Earth Observations. Secondary objectives of the mission include imaging of sub-surface geological structures in arid environments, generation of a true Digital Terrain Model without biases caused by forest cover, and measurement of glacier and icesheet velocities. In addition, the operations needed for ionospheric correction of the data will allow very sensitive estimates of ionospheric Total Electron Content and its changes along the dawn-dusk orbit of the mission.},
