Mucke99 states that this can be solved by choosing randomly the edge from which to 'switch' to the next triangle (or the facet to switch to the next tetra).

@article{Guth2021,
	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide fundamental depictions of the three-dimensional shape of the Earth's surface and are useful to a wide range of disciplines. Ideally, DEMs record the interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, with complexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intended use, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them. DEM is a general term, and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) record the treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible and near-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars and products of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storage structure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same convention for the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable data spacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understanding and reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users, who do not necessarily share the same background.},

@incollection{Bohner09,
	annote = {how terrain parameters/characteristic are useful for climatology

climatology uses terrain properties to predict and understand the climate, weather conditions averaged over a period of time. 

The solar irradiation (gradient, aspect, shading by features of the terrain (so they speak of sky-view factor), etc.) is useful to calculate the temperature of the ground at diff locations, to predict snow covering (elevation also plays a role). As is the case for 3DCM, the diffuse irradiation also plays a role.

Exposure to wind can be estimated using the land-surface parameters frequently used in modelling topographic solar radiation --- terrain aspect, illumination angle, horizon angle and sky view factor.

The chi-shape algorithm starts with the Delaunay triangulation (DT) of a set of input points P and iteratively removes the longest exterior edge of the triangulation that does not cause irregularity.

Thus, like alpha-shape but only one oring that is guaranteed to be simple and bound all points of the input set. Rather simple really.},

-I/O efficient (out-of-core)
-has the ability to look past a local neighbourhood through topology defined by graph.

How does it work: builts a graph from a delaunay triangulation with added diagonals, edges are then removed if the height span is larger than a treshold. Now only points in the largest connected component are kept, smaller connected components are regarded to as noise.},

This review highlights three feature types for which current ground filtering algorithms are suboptimal, and which can be improved upon in future studies: surfaces with rough terrain or discontinuous slope, dense forest areas that laser beams cannot penetrate, and regions with low vegetation that is often ignored by ground filters.},
