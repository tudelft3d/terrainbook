# Computational modelling of terrains

The book *Computational modelling of terrains* presents an overview of algorithms and methodologies to reconstruct terrains, to manipulate them, and to extract information from them.

It covers different representations of terrains (\eg\ TINs, rasters, point clouds, contour lines), discusses different applications (visibility analysis, runoff modelling, etc.), presents techniques to handle large datasets, and discusses related topics such as global elevation models and bathymetric datasets.

The book presents the theory and give some examples of libraries and software to perform certain tasks, but there is no code example given.
We wanted the book to be agnostic to the programming language.
On the website of the course for which this book was developed ([https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo1015](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo1015)), there are assignments available (Python and/or C++ are used by the students).
