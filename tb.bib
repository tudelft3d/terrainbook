-I/O efficient (out-of-core)
-has the ability to look past a local neighbourhood through topology defined by graph.

How does it work: builts a graph from a delaunay triangulation with added diagonals, edges are then removed if the height span is larger than a treshold. Now only points in the largest connected component are kept, smaller connected components are regarded to as noise.},

@incollection{Bohner09,
	annote = {how terrain parameters/characteristic are useful for climatology

climatology uses terrain properties to predict and understand the climate, weather conditions averaged over a period of time. 

The solar irradiation (gradient, aspect, shading by features of the terrain (so they speak of sky-view factor), etc.) is useful to calculate the temperature of the ground at diff locations, to predict snow covering (elevation also plays a role). As is the case for 3DCM, the diffuse irradiation also plays a role.

Exposure to wind can be estimated using the land-surface parameters frequently used in modelling topographic solar radiation --- terrain aspect, illumination angle, horizon angle and sky view factor.

(It is the apex of each d-simplex, not shared by the other d-simplex, that matters.) If a triangulation is Delaunay, every hyperface of the triangulation is locally Delaunay. Conversely, if every hyperface of a triangulation is locally Delaunay, then the triangulation is Delaunay (i.e. every simplex is Delaunay).

@article{Guth2021,
	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide fundamental depictions of the three-dimensional shape of the Earth's surface and are useful to a wide range of disciplines. Ideally, DEMs record the interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, with complexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intended use, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them. DEM is a general term, and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) record the treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible and near-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars and products of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storage structure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same convention for the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable data spacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understanding and reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users, who do not necessarily share the same background.},

	abstract = {At least 10 global digital elevation models (DEMs) at one-arc-second resolution now cover Earth. Comparing derived grids, like slope or curvature, preserves surface spatial relationships, and can be more important than just elevation values. Such comparisons provide more nuanced DEM rankings than just elevation root mean square error (RMSE) for a small number of points. We present three new comparison categories: fraction of unexplained variance (FUV) for grids with continuous floating point values; accuracy metrics for integer code raster classifications; and comparison of stream channel vector networks. We compare six global DEMs that are digital surface models (DSMs), and four edited versions that use machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to create a bare-earth digital terrain model (DTM) for different elevation ranges: full Earth elevations, under 120 m, under 80 m, and under 10 m. We find edited DTMs improve on elevation values, but because they do not incorporate other metrics in their training they do not improve overall on the source Copernicus DSM. We also rank 17 common geomorphic-derived grids for sensitivity to DEM quality, and document how landscape characteristics, especially slope, affect the results. None of the DEMs perform well in areas with low average slope compared to reference DTMs aggregated from 1 m airborne lidar data. This indicates that accurate work in low-relief areas grappling with global climate change should use airborne lidar or very high resolution image-derived DTMs.},

- analysis of tectonic evolution
- understand volcanic processes and hazards
- hydrological modelling + reconstruction of drainage network in Africa (old channel courses buried under an blanket of aeolian deposits; radar can penetrate dry sand)
